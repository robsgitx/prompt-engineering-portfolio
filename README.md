Welcome to my prompt engineering portfolio!  
Here, I showcase how refining prompts can guide AI to produce clearer, more useful, and professional outputs.

## Example 1: Customer Service Script

### Initial Prompt
"You are a customer service AI for an e-commerce store. Create a 10-line conversational script to handle a customer’s question about delayed shipping. Use a polite, empathetic tone, offer a solution (e.g., refund or expedited shipping), and include one follow-up question to ensure satisfaction."

### First Output (Issues)
- The script was professional and empathetic.  
- However, several lines exceeded 20 words and felt more like phone dialogue than concise customer support messaging.  

### Refined Prompt
"Keep each line under 20 words and use a professional yet warm tone."

### Final Output

Agent: Hi, thank you for contacting us. I’m sorry your order hasn’t arrived yet.
Customer: Yes, it was due two days ago.
Agent: I understand how frustrating that is. Let me check the shipment status for you.
Customer: Okay, thanks.
Agent: I see a carrier delay, but your package is still in transit.
Customer: That’s good to know.
Agent: To make this right, I can offer a partial refund or free expedited shipping next time.
Customer: I’d like expedited shipping, please.
Agent: Absolutely, I’ve added a credit for free expedited shipping on your account.
Agent: Does this solution fully meet your needs today?


### Key Takeaway
By refining the prompt, the output became shorter, clearer, and more aligned with professional customer service standards.
